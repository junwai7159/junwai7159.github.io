## Hadoop

- Doug Cutting decided to write a free, open-source implementation of Google's MapReduce
- A bit of dinosaur these days

Two parts to Hadoop:

1. **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)**
   1. Allows you to store data on a cluster of computers without worrying about what data is on which node
   2. Instead, you refer to locations in HDGS just as you would for files in a normal directory system
2. **The actual MR framework**
   1. Reads in data from HDFS, processes it in parallel, and writes its output to HDG
