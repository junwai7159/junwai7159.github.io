# Data Augmentation

## Models

- MixUp: generates a weighted combination of random image pairs
- Cutmix: cuts part of an image and replace it with a patch from another image
- Cutout
- RandAugment: applies a series of random augmentations such as rotation, translation, and shear
- Random Erasing: randomly selects a rectangle region in an image and erases its pixels with random values
