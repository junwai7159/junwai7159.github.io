## Speak the Language of Stocks

### How Stocks Trade

- When stocks are bought and sold, it's called **trading**
- Every company has a **ticker symbol**, e.g. Google (GOOG)
- A $1 move in stock price is called a **point**
- A block of 100 shares is called a **round lot**
- **Preferred stock:** set dividend that doesn't fluctuate based on how well the company is performing; receive dividends before common stockholders; paid first if the company fails and is liquidated
- **Common stock:** dividend fluctuates; entitles to voting rights

### How You Make Money Owning Stocks

1. **Capital Appreciation:** buy low sell high
2. **Dividends**
   1. On a **declaration date** in each quarter, the company decides what the dividend payout will be
   2. To receive a dividend, you must own the stock by the **ex-dividend date**, which is four business days before the company looks at the list of shareholders to see who gets the dividend
   3. The day the company actually looks at the list of shareholders is called the **record date**
   4. The company decides how much the dividend will be per share, multiplies the number of shares you own by the dividend, and deposits the total amount into your brokerage account
   5. Most publications report a company's annual dividend, not the quarterly
3. **Total Return:** captial appreciation + dividend
4. **Stock Splits**
   1. Occurs when a company increases the number of its stock shares outstanding without increasing shareholders' equity
   2. A common stock split is **2-for-1**
   3. Companies split their stock to make it affordable to more investors
   4. A company usually won't split its stock unless it's optimistic about the future
   5. **Lower prices tend to move quicker than higher prices**
