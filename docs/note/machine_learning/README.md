# Machine Learning

- approaching almost any ml problem
- ml with python, theory and implementation

Concepts:

- Learning rate scheduler (cosine)
- warmup
- Reduce LR on Plateau
- different optimizers
- Focal losses
- Exponential moving average(EMA)
- Restricted Boltzmann machine
- Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Conditional Random Fields (CRF),
